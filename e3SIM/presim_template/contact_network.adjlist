# This is the template file for the contact network.
# Lines starting with # will be viewed as comments
# This is a network with 5 hosts
# The contacts between the 5 hosts are: 0--1, 0--2, 1--4, 1--2, 2--3, 3--4
# The starting number of each row is the id of one host, and all numbers after the first are the ids of its connections.
# Each contact appears only once. For example, 0--1 is represented in the row starting with 0
# but not in the row starting with 1.
